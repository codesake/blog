The knowledge base library for Codesake::Dawn version 1.0.0.rc2 contains 142 security checks.

* Not revised code: Analyzing comments, it seems your code is waiting from some review from you. Please consider take action before putting it in production.
This check will analyze the source code looking for the following patterns: XXX, TO_CHECK, CHECKME, CHECK and FIXME
* Owasp Ror Cheatsheet: This Cheatsheet intends to provide quick basic Ruby on Rails security tips for developers. It complements, augments or emphasizes points brought up in the rails security guide from rails core.  The Rails framework abstracts developers from quite a bit of tedious work and provides the means to accomplish complex tasks quickly and with ease. New developers, those unfamiliar with the inner-workings of Rails, likely need a basic set of guidelines to secure fundamental aspects of their application. The intended purpose of this doc is to be that guide.
* Simple Form XSS - 20131129: There is a XSS vulnerability on Simple Form's label, hint and error options. When Simple Form creates a label, hint or error message it marks the text as being HTML safe, even though it may contain HTML tags. In applications where the text of these helpers can be provided by the users, malicious values can be provided and Simple Form will mark it as safe.
* Nokogiri - Denial of service - 20131217: There is a vulnerability in Nokogiri when using JRuby where the parser can enter an infinite loop and exhaust the process memory. Nokogiri users on JRuby using the native Java extension.  Attackers can send XML documents with carefully crafted documents which can cause the XML processor to enter an infinite loop, causing the server to run out of memory and crash.
* Nokogiri - Entity expasion denial of service - 20131217: There is an entity expansion vulnerability in Nokogiri when using JRuby. Nokogiri users on JRuby using the native Java extension.  Attackers can send
XML documents with carefully crafted entity expansion strings which can cause the server to run out of memory and crash.

* [CVE-2013-2065](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-2065): Native functions exposed to Ruby with DL or Fiddle do not check the taint values set on the objects passed in. This can result in tainted objects being accepted as input when a SecurityError exception should be raised.
* [CVE-2013-2090](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-2090): Ruby Gem Creme Fraiche version 0.6 suffers from a remote command injection vulnerability due to unsanitized input.
* [CVE-2013-2119](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-2119): Phusion Passenger gem before 3.0.21 and 4.0.x before 4.0.5 for Ruby allows local users to cause a denial of service (prevent application start) or gain privileges by pre-creating a temporary "config" file in a directory with a predictable name in /tmp/ before it is used by the gem.
* [CVE-2013-2615](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-2615): lib/entry_controller.rb in the fastreader Gem 1.0.8 for Ruby allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via shell metacharacters in a URL.
* [CVE-2013-2616](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-2616): lib/mini_magick.rb in the MiniMagick Gem 1.3.1 for Ruby allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via shell metacharacters in a URL.
* [CVE-2013-2617](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-2617): lib/curl.rb in the Curl Gem for Ruby allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via shell metacharacters in a URL.
* [CVE-2013-3221](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-3221): The Active Record component in Ruby on Rails 2.3.x, 3.0.x, 3.1.x, and 3.2.x does not ensure that the declared data type of a database column is used during comparisons of input values to stored values in that column, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct data-type injection attacks against Ruby on Rails applications via a crafted value, as demonstrated by unintended interaction between the "typed XML" feature and a MySQL database.
* [CVE-2013-4164](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-4164): Any time a string is converted to a floating point value, a specially crafted string can cause a heap overflow. This can lead to a denial of service attack via segmentation faults and possibly arbitrary code execution. Any program that converts input of unknown origin to floating point values (especially common when accepting JSON) are vulnerable.
* [CVE-2013-4389](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-4389): Multiple format string vulnerabilities in log_subscriber.rb files in the log subscriber component in Action Mailer in Ruby on Rails 3.x before 3.2.15 allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service via a crafted e-mail address that is improperly handled during construction of a log message.
* [CVE-2013-4457](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-4457): The Cocaine gem 0.4.0 through 0.5.2 for Ruby allows context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary commands via a crafted has object, related to recursive variable interpolation.
* [CVE-2013-4478](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-4478): Sup before 0.13.2.1 and 0.14.x before 0.14.1.1 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via shell metacharacters in the filename of an email attachment.
* [CVE-2013-4479](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-4479): lib/sup/message_chunks.rb in Sup before 0.13.2.1 and 0.14.x before 0.14.1.1 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via shell metacharacters in the content_type of an email attachment.
* [CVE-2013-4491](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-4491): Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in actionpack/lib/action_view/helpers/translation_helper.rb in the internationalization component in Ruby on Rails 3.x before 3.2.16 and 4.x before 4.0.2 allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via a crafted string that triggers generation of a fallback string by the i18n gem.
* [CVE-2013-4492](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-4492): Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in exceptions.rb in the i18n gem before 0.6.6 for Ruby allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via a crafted I18n::MissingTranslationData.new call.
* [CVE-2013-4562](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-4562): Because of the way that omniauth-facebook supports setting a per-request state parameter by storing it in the session, it is possible to circumvent the automatic CSRF protection. Therefore the CSRF added in 1.4.1 should be considered broken. If you are currently providing a custom state, you will need to store and retrieve this yourself (for example, by using the session store) to use 1.5.0.
* [CVE-2013-5647](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-5647): lib/sounder/sound.rb in the sounder gem 1.0.1 for Ruby allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via shell metacharacters in a filename.
* [CVE-2013-6414](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-6414): actionpack/lib/action_view/lookup_context.rb in Action View in Ruby on Rails 3.x before 3.2.16 and 4.x before 4.0.2 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via a header containing an invalid MIME type that leads to excessive caching.
* [CVE-2013-6415](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-6415): Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the number_to_currency helper in actionpack/lib/action_view/helpers/number_helper.rb in Ruby on Rails before 3.2.16 and 4.x before 4.0.2 allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the unit parameter.
* [CVE-2013-6416](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-6416): Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the simple_format helper in actionpack/lib/action_view/helpers/text_helper.rb in Ruby on Rails 4.x before 4.0.2 allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via a crafted HTML attribute.
* [CVE-2013-6417](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-6417): actionpack/lib/action_dispatch/http/request.rb in Ruby on Rails before 3.2.16 and 4.x before 4.0.2 does not properly consider differences in parameter handling between the Active Record component and the JSON implementation, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended database-query restrictions and perform NULL checks or trigger missing WHERE clauses via a crafted request that leverages (1) third-party Rack middleware or (2) custom Rack middleware. NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2013-0155.
* [CVE-2013-6421](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-6421): The unpack_zip function in archive_unpacker.rb in the sprout gem 0.7.246 for Ruby allows context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary commands via shell metacharacters in a (1) filename or (2) path.
* [CVE-2013-6459](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-6459): Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the will_paginate gem before 3.0.5 for Ruby allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via vectors involving generated pagination links.
* [CVE-2013-7086](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-7086): The message function in lib/webbynode/notify.rb in the Webbynode gem 1.0.5.3 and earlier for Ruby allows context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary commands via shell metacharacters in a growlnotify message.
