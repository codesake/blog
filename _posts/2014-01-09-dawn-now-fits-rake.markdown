Since [this commit I made yesterday](https://github.com/codesake/codesake-dawn/commit/41a42068fb11c5a8556f21efdea528099d688a51),
when I do install [codesake-dawn](https://rubygems.org/gems/codesake-dawn)
rubygem you have a specific task executing dawn on the current directory.

``` 
rake dawn
``` 

Enjoy it
