[This commit I made this morning](https://github.com/codesake/codesake-dawn/commit/12a8e4b38ba24ea4f2a60acabc9be5820c4cb1a3)
introduces the 100th security scan in
[codesake-dawn](http://rubygems.org/gems/codesake-dawn) knowledge library.

This is a huge step forward [version 1.0.0](https://raw.github.com/codesake/codesake-dawn/master/Roadmap.md) I
expect to launch in a couple of weeks. There are some old CVE bulletins I want
to add in #dawnscanner, even if they are completely outdate just for sake of
completeness.

There is also a [@dawnscanner twitter account](https://twitter.com/dawnscanner)
you may want to follow to stay in touch with the project.

Enjoy it!
